## v1.0.1 - Telegram message polish
Freshened the Telegram module docs and dependency references so teams can understand configuration details faster and rely on the latest HTTP/log helpers for delivery.

### Changed
- Rewrote the public docs to highlight usage, configuration options, and examples with clear calls-to-action and linking to instago.ai.
- Pointed the runtime code at `http@latest` and `log@latest`, keeping the module aligned with the newest service helpers.
